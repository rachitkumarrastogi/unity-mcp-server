# Unity MCP Server Release v1.5.1

**Release date:** 2026-02-16

Documentation update so developers know exactly what to type in Claude, Cursor, or other MCP clients to use each tool.

## Summary of changes

### Changed

- **README:** Added an **Example prompt to type** column to every tools table (all categories). Each tool now shows example phrases you can type in chat (e.g. *"What's my project path and Unity version?"* for `get_project_info`).
- **README:** Query examples for `search_tools` (e.g. "find references", "missing script", "prefab") and a short "What to type in Claude/Cursor" section that points to those columns.

No new tools or behavior changes; same 101 tools as v1.5.0.

**Install:** `npx unity-mcp-server` or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unity-mcp-server) / [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/?q=unity-mcp-server).
